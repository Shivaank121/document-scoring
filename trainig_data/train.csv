When I went to get it changed next day, the shop owner behaved in a very arrogant manner and even said that the piece was ok when sold and we had caused the damage ! How terrible a behavior ! When we objected to such irresponsible remarks, he said he was allowing us to replace it but said  this was purely an obligaton on us ! Instead of apologising for having sold a defective piece the owner behaved in the most arrogant manner possible. We strongly advise all tourists to avoid dealing with this shop. We ultimately refused to change the piece out of sheer disappointment and to deprive the owner an opportunity to load an obligation on us. We valued our self respect more than the money spent on the defective garment",0,1,1,0,1,0,0

Bara Bazaar,"In contrast to the previous reviewer, we found the Bara Bazaar fascinating. It is indeed a truly local market and not for tourists. The other markets we found to be rather disappointing copies of western-style shops, whereas the Bara was full of colourful, genuine, local tradespeople. Deliveries into the narrow alleys were of necessity by foot and therefore huge trunks and packages were carried - traditional-style - on the backs of the tradesmen, using worryingly flimsy-looking material bands around the forehead. It was busy on the day we visited, but not too crowded to spend time trying to identify the various spices on show, cheek-by-jowl with live maggots (a delicacy, we understand!) and rainbow-coloured shalwar kameez. However, when it comes to clothing, the most attractive items were the tartan shawls - useful for the cold nights  in winter up here at 6 thousand feet - a leftover from the days of the Welsh and Scottish missionaries.
